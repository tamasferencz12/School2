<h2>Not a black box</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Here is a classic "Hello, World!" program â€” a friendly greeting from your computer. What do its <strong>first three lines </strong>do?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>You may not understand every word as when learning a foreign language. Try to use your language intuition and associate lines with their functions.</p>
