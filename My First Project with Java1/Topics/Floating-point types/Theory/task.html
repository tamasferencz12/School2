<p>A floating point numeral refers generally to the notation of a number which contains an integer part, a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a fractional part in the context of floating point numerals refers to the portion of the number that appears after the decimal separator. | For instance, in the number 3.1415, 1415 is the fractional part. Floating point numbers in Java, which can represent fractional parts, come in two types: float and double. These types, however, cannot represent all decimal numbers exactly due to their limited number of significant decimal digits (6-7 for float and 14-16 for double). Furthermore, double can represent a wider range of numbers than float.">fractional part</a> and their separator (for example 0.01 or 3.1415). Such numbers represent fractions which are often used in science, statistics, engineering, and many other fields.</p>
<p>Java has two basic types to represent such numbers: <code class="language-java">float</code> and <code class="language-java">double</code>. They are called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, floating-point types are data types that represent fractional numbers, which consist of an integer part, a fractional part, and a separator. | Java has two basic types for this purpose: float and double.

In practice, programmers often use the double type, and it is recommended for code challenges. It is essential to pay attention to errors during computation and the use of the decimal separator when reading floating-point numbers.">floating-point types</a></strong>. In fact, these types cannot represent an arbitrary decimal number, because they support only a limited number of significant decimal digits (6-7 for <code class="language-java">float</code>, and 14-16 for <code class="language-java">double</code>). In addition, <code class="language-java">double</code> can represent a wider <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a range refers to a sequence of values between a lower and upper boundary, including both. | This concept is often used in the context of generating random numbers within a specific range or defining character sets using regular expressions. For example, you can specify a range of characters in a set using the dash symbol, where the character before the dash denotes the starting point and the character after it is the last character within the range. This is particularly useful when defining alphabetically ordered letters and numeric values.">range</a> of numbers than <code class="language-java">float</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, programmers mostly use the <code class="language-java">double</code> type and we recommend you to use it for our code challenges. But all the information below is valid for the <code class="language-java">float</code> type as well.</p>
<h5 id="declaring-variables-and-assigning-values" style="text-align: center;">Declaring variables and assigning values</h5>
<p>In a program, the <code class="language-java">double</code> literal looks like <code class="language-java">5.2</code> where the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="is a special character in regular expressions that matches any single character, including letters, digits, spaces, and other special characters, but not the newline character. | It is often used to define a pattern that matches several different strings. When combined with the question mark (. ), it can mean there can be any single character or no character at all. However, if you want to use the dot or the question mark as regular punctuation marks, you should escape them with a backslash (\).">dot character</a> separates the integer and fractional parts of a number.</p>
<p>There are several initialized <code class="language-java">double</code> variables below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double zero = 0.0;
double one = 1.0;
double negNumber = -1.75;
double pi = 3.1415;

System.out.println(pi); // 3.1415</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to assign an integer value to a  <code class="language-java">double</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double one = 1;
System.out.println(one); // 1.0</code></pre>
<p>If you want to declare and initialize a <code class="language-java">float</code> variable, you must mark the assigned value with the special letter <code class="language-java">f</code> (float literal):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">float pi = 3.1415f;
float negValue = -0.15f;
System.out.println(pi); // 3.1415 without f</code></pre>
<p>Both types can store only a limited number of significant decimal digits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">float f = 0.888888888888888888f; // a value with a lot of decimal digits
System.out.println(f);           // it only prints 0.8888889</code></pre>
<p>Floating-point types have a specific way to mark values with a mantissa:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double eps = 5e-3; // means 5 * 10^(-3) = 0.005
double n = 0.01e2; // means 0.01 * 10^2 = 1.0</code></pre>
<h5 id="arithmetic-operations" style="text-align: center;">Arithmetic operations</h5>
<p>You can perform all types of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus or remainder (%) operators. Arithmetic operations take two values or operands, with the exception of unary operators such as unary plus (+) and unary minus (-), which take a single value. The order of operation follows the standard arithmetic rules, with multiplication and division having a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and for clarity. The unary plus operator indicates a positive value, while the unary minus operator negates a value or an expression.">arithmetic operations</a> with floating-point types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double one = 1.0;
double number = one + 1.5; // 2.5

double a = 1.75;
double b = 5.0;
double c = b - a; // 3.25

double pi = 3.1415;
double squaredPi = pi * pi; // 9.86902225</code></pre>
<p>For <code class="language-java">double</code> and <code class="language-java">float</code> operands, the operator <code class="language-java">/</code> performs a division, not an integer division.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(squaredPi / 2); // 4.934511125</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pay attention</strong> to an important thing that beginners often miss:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double d1 = 5 / 4; // 1.0
double d2 = 5.0 / 4; // 1.25</code></pre>
<p>In the first case, we perform integer division that produces an integer result and then assign the result to <code class="language-java">d1</code>. In the second case, we perform a real division that produces a double value and then assign the value to <code class="language-java">d2</code>.</p>
<h5 id="errors-during-computations" style="text-align: center;">Errors during computations</h5>
<p>Be careful! Operations with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a floating-point number is a type of numeral that represents fractional numbers, consisting of an integer part, a fractional part, and a separator (e.g., 0.01 or 3.1415). | Java has two basic types to represent such numbers: float and double, which are called floating-point types. These types can only represent a limited number of significant decimal digits (6-7 for float and 14-16 for double) and cannot represent all real numbers exactly. Programmers mostly use the type float, but it is recommended to use double for greater precision. Floating-point numbers can be represented using floating-point literals, which consist of digits, a decimal point, and an optional suffix to indicate the type.">floating-point numbers</a> can produce an inaccurate result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(3.3 / 3); // prints 1.0999999999999999</code></pre>
<p>Errors can accumulate during computation. In the following example we calculate the sum of ten decimals <strong>0.1</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double d = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1;
System.out.println(d); // it prints 0.9999999999999999</code></pre>
<p>Such errors happen because floating point numbers are actually stored and operated in binary form and not all real numbers can be represented exactly (similarly, we cannot represent the exact value of the 1/3 fraction in decimal form). In the following topics, we will find out how to deal with this issue. For now, just take it into consideration.</p>

<h5 id="reading-floating-point-numbers" style="text-align: center;">Reading floating-point numbers</h5>
<p>You can use a <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> to read the values of both floating-point  types from the standard input.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

float f = scanner.nextFloat();
double d = scanner.nextDouble();</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned above, we recommend you use <code class="language-java">double</code> to solve our programming problems.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a program that calculates the <code class="language-java">area</code> of a triangle. To find it, the program reads the <code class="language-java">base</code> and the <code class="language-java">height</code> from the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the standard input is a default source of input for a program, which is typically associated with the keyboard. | It is a mechanism provided by the operating system for a program to consume data and can be redirected from a file or other sources. The standard input is commonly used in programming problems to read data, process it, and output the result to the standard output. It can be accessed in Java using the System.in class, which allows a program to read values of various types from the standard input.">standard input</a>, then multiplies them, and divides by 2. Note that the base and the height are perpendicular to each other.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class AreaOfTriangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        double base = scanner.nextDouble();
        double height = scanner.nextDouble();

        double area = (base * height) / 2;

        System.out.println(area);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 3.3 meters and a height of 4.5 meters.</p>
<p><strong>Input 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-css">3.3 4.5</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-css">7.425</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it's area is 7.425 square meters!</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind</strong> that the output of this program may have a lot of zeros like the output below because an operation with floating-point numbers can produce inaccurate results.</p>
<p><strong>Input 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-css">2.2 4.01</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-css">4.4110000000000005</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to round or format a double result, but we will not do it in this lesson. In the coding problems, output a result as-is.</p>
<h5 id="the-decimal-separator" style="text-align: center;">The decimal separator</h5>
<p>If you solve our coding problems locally or try to repeat our examples, you may encounter a problem with your computer having different locale settings. In this case, the <strong>Scanner</strong> cannot read floating-point numbers with the dot character (<strong>3.1415</strong>). Try to input numbers written with the comma separator (<strong>3,1415</strong>).</p>
<p>If you want to use the dot character without modifying your local settings, try using the following code to create a scanner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in).useLocale(Locale.US);</code></pre>
