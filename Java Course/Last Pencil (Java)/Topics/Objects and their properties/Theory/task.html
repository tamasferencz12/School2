<p>A typical <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which can represent real-world entities or abstract concepts. | Each object has its own state, which is stored in fields, and behavior, which is defined by methods. Objects are instances of classes, which serve as blueprints that define the properties and methods of their corresponding objects. OOP emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software design more reusable and maintainable. It is a good practice to use interface-oriented design, which means relying on interfaces instead of concrete implementations. Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in programming. Java is primarily an object-oriented programming language, but it also supports other programming paradigms, such as functional programming. OOP provides a way to create well-structured and readable programs by allowing developers to define the behavior of objects and classes using methods.">object-oriented</a> program consists of a set of interacting <strong>objects</strong>. Each object has its own state separated from others. Each object is an instance of a particular class (type) that defines common properties and possible behavior for its objects.</p>
<p>All classes from the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a standard library refers to the pre-written collection of classes, interfaces, and methods that are included in the Java Development Kit (JDK). | These libraries provide reusable code for common programming tasks, such as working with collections. The standard library includes several types of collections, such as lists, sets, and maps, which are represented by different classes from the java.util package. These collections can store reference types, including custom classes, and can be either mutable or immutable. When the standard libraries do not provide sufficient functionality, developers can use external libraries, such as the Guava collection library developed by Google, or create their own collections.">standard library</a> (<strong><code class="language-java">String</code></strong>, <strong><code class="language-java">Date</code></strong>) and classes defined by programmers are <strong>reference</strong><strong> types</strong> which means that <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variables</a> of these types store addresses where the actual objects are located. In this regard, the comparison and assignment operations work with objects differently than with primitive types.</p>
<h5 id="creating-objects" style="text-align: center;">Creating objects</h5>
<p>The keyword <strong>new</strong> creates an object of a particular class. Here we create a standard string and assign it to the variable <strong><code class="language-java">str</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String str = new String("hello");</code></pre>
<p>The variable <strong><code class="language-java">str</code></strong> stores a reference to the object <strong>"hello"</strong> located somewhere in the heap memory.</p>
<p>In the same way, we can create an object of any class we know.</p>
<p>Here is a class that describes a patient in a hospital information system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is an instance of this class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();</code></pre>
<p>Despite the fact that <strong><code class="language-java">String</code></strong> is a standard class and <strong><code class="language-java">Patient</code></strong> is our own class, both classes are regular <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference types</a>. However, there is a big difference between those classes and we will discuss it below. </p>
<h5 id="immutability-of-objects" style="text-align: center;">Immutability of objects</h5>
<p>There is an important concept in programming called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, immutability is a concept that refers to an object's ability to always store the same value. | Once created, an immutable object cannot be changed. If we need to modify the value of an immutable object, we should create a new object instead. A common example of an immutable object is the String class, where all string operations produce a new string. This is because strings in Java are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. Immutable objects help to write programs with fewer errors as they cannot be modified once created, ensuring the data remains consistent.">immutability</a></strong>. Immutability means that an object always stores the same values. If we need to modify these values, we should create a new object.

<p>The class <strong><code class="language-java">Patient</code></strong> is not immutable because it is possible to change any field of an object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();

patient.name = "Mary";
patient.name = "Alice";</code></pre>
<p>In the following topics, we will look at the existing immutable classes as well as learn how to create new ones and when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="sharing-references" style="text-align: center;">Sharing references</h5>
<p>More than one variable can refer to the same object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();

patient.name = "Mary";
patient.age = 24;

System.out.println(patient.name + " " + patient.age); // Mary 24

Patient p = patient;

System.out.println(p.name + " " + p.age); // Mary 24
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to understand that two variables refer to the same data in memory rather than two independent copies. Since our class is mutable, we can modify the object using both references.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">patient.age = 25;
System.out.println(p.age); // 25</code></pre>
<h5 id="nullability" style="text-align: center;">Nullability</h5>
<p>As for any reference type, a variable of a class type can be <strong>null</strong> which means it is not initialized yet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = null;</code></pre>
<p>This is a common feature in Java available for classes since they are reference types.</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary">Attempting to access a reference that points to <strong>null</strong> will result in an <strong>exception</strong>. It indicates that you're trying to perform an operation on a non-existent object. We'll deal with this topic in the following topics.</div>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>By now, not only have we already worked with some classes from the standard library but also learned how Java allows us to create our own classes. In this topic, we've discussed that the nature of custom classes' objects and standard library ones are based on the same principles.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, that classes defined by programmers are <strong>reference types</strong>. When objects are created by the <strong>new</strong> operator it returns a reference in memory where the created objects are located. With this reference, we can get access to fields and change them. Several variables can refer to the same object through a reference. It is also possible to create two independent objects with the same field's content. It's important to understand that references to such objects are different. However, not all objects allow changing their state after creation. Such a feature is called <strong>immutability</strong>.</p>
