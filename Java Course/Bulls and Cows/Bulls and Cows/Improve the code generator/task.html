<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>The algorithm suggested for generating the secret code in the previous stage was really a “reinvention of the wheel”. Java already has the tools for generating random numbers! Research some common pseudo-random generation methods, such as <code class="java">Math.random()</code> and other methods from the <code class="java">Random</code> class. Choose the method you like and use it to rewrite the secret code generation. To learn more about the <code class="java">Random</code> class, jump to <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/4910" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Random</a> topic. If you want to get to know all the intricacies of the <code class="java">Math</code> library, don't forget to check out the <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3501" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Math</a> library topic as well.</p><p>Nothing else is supposed to change at this stage: the program asks for the length, generates a secret code, and then receives and grades the attempts until the code is guessed. Your task here is to rewrite the code generator without breaking the existing code.</p><h5 id="objective">Objective</h5><p>In this stage, rewrite the secret code generator using a suitable Java method.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space <code class="java">&gt; </code> represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Please, enter the secret code's length:

Okay, let's start a game!
Turn 1:
&gt; 1234
Grade: 1 bull and 1 cow
Turn 2:
&gt; 7354
Grade: 2 bulls and 1 cow
Turn 3:
&gt; 9374
Grade: 4 bulls
Congratulations! You guessed the secret code.</code></pre>
