<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is a mechanism for deriving a new class from another class (<a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a base class, also known as a superclass or parent class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods.

An abstract class is often used as a base class in a hierarchy, and it represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses.">base class</a>). The new class acquires some fields and methods of the base class. Inheritance is one of the main principles of object-oriented programming.

In the context of a company's activity, for example, a class hierarchy could include a base class with common data fields such as name, year of birth, and address. Derived classes could then add additional fields specific to their purpose, such as a contract number and status for a client class, or start date of work and salary for an employee class. In Java, a class can only inherit from one superclass, but a superclass can have multiple subclasses. It's important to note that constructors are not inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass. When working with class hierarchies, you can refer to a subclass object in two ways: using a subclass reference or using a superclass reference. The latter allows you to refer to any subclass using a superclass reference variable.">class hierarchies</a> and reuse existing code.</p>

<p>When it comes to inheritance, there are several terms. A class <strong>derived</strong> from another class is called a <strong>subclass</strong> (it's also known as a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a derived class is a subclass that inherits all public and protected fields and methods from its superclass. | It can also add new fields and methods, and the inherited and added members can be used in the same way. A derived class is related to its superclass through a parent-child relationship, where the derived class is the child and the superclass is the parent. This relationship allows for polymorphism, where a derived class object can be referred to using a superclass reference variable, providing flexibility and reusability in object-oriented programming.">derived class</a></strong>, <strong>extended class</strong> or <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a child class is a class that is derived from another class, also known as the superclass or parent class. | A child class inherits all public and protected fields and methods from its superclass and can also add new fields and methods.

A child class can be referred to using either their own reference or a reference of their superclass, allowing for polymorphism and code reuse.">child class</a></strong>). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a <strong>superclass</strong> (also a <strong>base class</strong> or a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a parent class, also known as a superclass or base class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods.

<p>To derive a new class from another, the keyword <code class="language-java">extends</code> is used. The common syntax is shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SuperClass { }

class SubClassA extends SuperClass { }

class SubClassB extends SuperClass { }

class SubClassC extends SubClassA { }</code></pre>
<p>There are important points about inheritance in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Java doesn't support multiple-class inheritance, meaning that a class can only inherit from a single superclass;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a class hierarchy can have multiple levels (class <code class="language-java">C</code> can extend class <code class="language-java">B</code> that extends class <code class="language-java">A</code>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a superclass can have more than one subclass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A subclass inherits all public and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a protected field is a type of field that has protected access modifier. | This means that the field can be accessed within the same class, within the same package, and within the subclasses of the class, but it cannot be accessed from any other class outside of its package and not related through inheritance. This mechanism provides a way to encapsulate the implementation details of a class and control the data access, ensuring security and predictability of the code behavior.">protected fields</a> and methods from the superclass. A subclass can also add new fields and methods. The inherited and added members will be used in the same way.</p>
<p>A subclass doesn't inherit <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a private field is a field that is declared with the access modifier 'private', which restricts access to that field to the class in which it is declared. | This means that other classes, even if they are in the same package, cannot directly access or modify the private field of the class. By using the private access modifier, you can encapsulate the implementation details of a class and provide a controlled interface for other classes to interact with it. Private fields are typically not exposed directly to other classes. Instead, they are made accessible through accessor methods, also known as getter and setter methods. These methods provide encapsulation, which allows you to hide implementation details and control data access, ensuring security. According to the data encapsulation principle, the field of a class should not be directly accessed from other classes. Instead, the field can be accessed only through the methods of that particular class. To access a hidden field, programmers write special types of methods called getters and setters. Getters can only read the field, and setters can only write to the field. For example, a class may have four fields, each of which is declared as private to hide the field from direct access from other classes. The class may also have public getters and setters for accessing the fields through these methods.">private fields</a> and methods from the superclass. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these members can be used inside subclasses.</p>
<p>Constructors are not inherited, but the superclass's constructor can be invoked from the subclass using the special keyword <code class="language-java">super</code>. This keyword is discussed in more detail in another topic.</p>
<p>If you'd like the base <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a class member is a variable or method that is declared within a class. | This can include both instance members, which are shared by all objects of a class but have unique values for each object, and static members, which are shared by all objects of a class and have the same value for all instances. Class members can be used to encapsulate related functionality and data, and can include fields, methods, inner classes, and nested classes.">class members</a> to be accessible from all subclasses but not from the outside code (excluding the same package), use the access modifier <code class="language-java">protected</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> represents the <strong>IS-A</strong> relationship. A base class represents the general and a subclass represents the particular or specific.</p>
<h5 id="an-example-of-a-class-hierarchy">An example of a class hierarchy</h5>
<p>Let's consider a more graphic example. A telecommunication company serves clients. It has a small staff consisting only of managers and programmers. Let's consider a class hierarchy for people associated with the company's activities (including clients).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The class hierarchy for the telecommunication company</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the base class <code class="language-java">Person</code> has fields for storing common data: name, year of birth, and address;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the class <code class="language-java">Client</code> has additional fields to store the contract number and status (gold or not);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the class <code class="language-java">Employee</code> stores the start date of work for the company and the salary;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>the class <code class="language-java">Manager</code> may have a dazzling smile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see the code:</p>

    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    // public getters and setters for all fields here

<p>This hierarchy has two levels and five classes overall. All fields are <code class="language-java">protected</code> , which means they are visible to subclasses. Each class also has public getters and setters, but some are skipped in the code as these classes use the default <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3583" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a no-argument constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments and is used to initialize the instance variables of a class with their default values. | If a class does not define any constructor, the Java compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor. However, if a class defines any specific constructor, the default no-argument constructor will not be created.">no-argument constructor</a>.</p>
<p>Let's create an object of the <code class="language-java">Programmer</code> class and fill the inherited fields using the inherited setters. To read the values of the fields, we can use inherited getters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Programmer p = new Programmer();

p.setName("John Elephant");
p.setYearOfBirth(1985);
p.setAddress("Some street, 15");
p.setStartDate(new Date());
p.setSalary(500_000L);
p.setProgrammingLanguages(new String[] { "Java", "Scala", "Kotlin" });

System.out.println(p.getName()); // John Elephant
System.out.println(p.getSalary()); // 500000
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(p.getProgrammingLanguages())); // [Java, Scala, Kotlin]</code></pre>
<p>We also can create an instance of any class included in the considered hierarchy.</p>
<p>So,<strong> inheritance</strong> provides a powerful mechanism for code reuse and writing convenient hierarchies. Many things in the real world can be simulated, like hierarchies from a more general to a more particular concept.</p>
<h5 id="final-classes">Final classes</h5>
<p>If a class is declared with the keyword <code class="language-java">final</code>, it cannot have subclasses at all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">final class SuperClass { }</code></pre>
<p>If you try to extend the class, a compile-time error will occur.</p>
<p>Some standard classes are declared as final: <code class="language-java">Integer</code>, <code class="language-java">Long</code>, <code class="language-java">String</code>, <code class="language-java">Math</code>. They cannot be extended from.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong> allows you to build class hierarchies where subclasses (children) take some fields and methods of the superclass (parent). Such a hierarchy can have multiple levels, but every class can inherit only from a single superclass. A good class hierarchy helps to avoid code duplication and makes your program more modular. If a class should not have subclasses, it should be marked as <code class="language-java">final</code>.</p>
