<p>Sometimes when we define a new subclass we need to access members or constructors of its superclass. Java provides a special keyword <code class="language-java">super</code> to do this. This keyword can be used in several cases:</p>

Instance fields can be accessed within the class using the this keyword. They are often used to store and manipulate the state of an object, and provide more functionality compared to static fields.">instance fields</a> of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3588" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a parent class, also known as a superclass or base class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods.

<p>Let's consider all of these cases with examples.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-superclass-fields-and-methods">Accessing superclass fields and methods</h5>
<p>The keyword <code class="language-java">super</code> can be used to access <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3588" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance method is a method that belongs to each object created of a particular class. | It can access fields of the specific object of the class. For example, if we have a class with two instance methods: method1() and method2(), and two objects: object1 and object2, the output of these methods will be different for each object because they have different values for the fields. To use an instance method, you must first create an object.">instance methods</a> or fields of the superclass. In a sense, it is similar to the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code>, but it refers to the immediate parent class object.</p>
<p>The keyword <code class="language-java">super</code> is optional if members of a subclass have different names from members of the superclass. Otherwise, using <code class="language-java">super</code> is the right way to access hidden (with the same name) members of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3588" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a base class, also known as a superclass or parent class, is a class that is extended by another class, known as a subclass or derived class. | It serves as a blueprint for the subclass, providing it with inherited fields and methods. A parent class can have multiple child classes, but a child class can only have one parent class due to Java's single inheritance feature. The parent class reference can be used to refer to any subclass object derived from that superclass. An abstract class is often used as a base class in a hierarchy, and it represents an abstract concept that is used as a base class for subclasses.">base class</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> There are two classes: <code class="language-java">SuperClass</code> and <code class="language-java">SubClass</code>. Each class has a field and a method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SuperClass {
    
    protected int field;

    protected int getField() {
        return field;
    }
    
    protected void printBaseValue() {
        System.out.println(field);
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    
    protected int field;

    public SubClass() {
        this.field = 30;  // It initializes the field of SubClass
        field = 30;       // It also initializes the field of SubClass
        super.field = 20; // It initializes the field of SuperClass
    }

    /**     
     * It prints the value of SuperClass and then the value of SubClass
     */
    public void printSubValue() {
        super.printBaseValue(); // It invokes the method of SuperClass, super is optional here
        System.out.println(field);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In the constructor of <code class="language-java">SubClass</code> , the superclass field is initialized using the keyword <code class="language-java">super</code>. We need to use the keyword here because the subclass field hides the base class field with the same name.</p>
<p>In the body of the method <code class="language-java">printSubValue</code> , the superclass method <code class="language-java">printBaseValue</code> is invoked. Here, the keyword <code class="language-java">super</code> is optional. It is required when a subclass method has the same name as a method in the base class. This case will be considered in the topic concerning <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3588" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, overriding is a mechanism that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a superclass method. | When a method is overridden, the name and parameter of the subclass method must be exactly the same as the superclass method. However, the return type can be the same as the superclass method or a subtype of it. This feature is known as the covariant return type. Overriding enables subclasses to redefine behavior inherited from their superclass, allowing them to add their own unique flair to inherited methods.">overriding</a>.</p>
<h5 id="invoking-superclass-constructor">Invoking superclass constructor</h5>
<p>Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, but a superclass constructor can be invoked from a subclass using the keyword <code class="language-java">super</code> <strong>with parentheses</strong>. We can also pass some arguments to the superclass constructor.</p>
<p>Two important points:</p>
<ul><li><p>Invoking <code class="language-java">super(...)</code> must be the first statement in a subclass constructor, otherwise, the code cannot be compiled;</p></li><li><p>The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3588" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a default constructor is a no-argument constructor that is automatically provided by the Java compiler if no constructor is explicitly defined in a class. | It initializes all fields with their default value. If a specific constructor is defined, the default constructor will not be created. No-argument constructors are useful in cases when any default value is better than no value at all. They allow you to create an instance of the class using the no-argument default constructor, in which all fields will be filled with the default value of their type.">default constructor</a> of a subclass automatically calls the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3588" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a no-argument constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments and is used to initialize the instance variables of a class with their default values. | If a class does not define any constructor, the Java compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor. However, if a class defines any specific constructor, the default no-argument constructor will not be created.">no-argument constructor</a> of the superclass.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Here are two classes <code class="language-java">Person</code> and <code class="language-java">Employee</code>. The second class extends the first one. Each class has a constructor to initialize fields.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Person {

    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    public Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // getters and setters
}

class Employee extends Person {

    protected Date startDate;
    protected Long salary;

    public Employee(String name, int yearOfBirth, String address, Date startDate, Long salary) {
        super(name, yearOfBirth, address); // invoking a constructor of the superclass
        
        this.startDate = startDate;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // getters and setters
}</code></pre>
<p>In the provided example, the constructor of the class <code class="language-java">Employee</code> invokes the parent class constructor to assign values to the passed fields. In a way, it resembles working with multiple constructors using <code class="language-java">this()</code>.</p>
