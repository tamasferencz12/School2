<p><strong>Constructors</strong> are special methods that initialize a <strong>new object </strong>of the class. A constructor of a class is invoked when an instance is created using the keyword <code class="language-java">new</code>.</p>
<p>A constructor is different from other methods in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it has the same name as the class that contains it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it has no <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return type is the data type of the value returned by a method. | Methods can return various types of data, such as integers, strings, or objects, depending on their implementation. If a method does not return a value, its return type is specified as void. When a method is called, the returned value can be assigned to a variable, printed, or passed as an argument to another method. Java also supports covariant return types, which allow a subclass to narrow the return type of an overridden method to a subtype of the original return type.">return type</a> (not even <code class="language-java">void</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Constructors initialize <strong>instances</strong> (objects) of the class. They set values to the fields when the object is created. Also, constructors can take parameters for initializing fields by the given values.</p>
<h5 id="using-constructors">Using constructors</h5>
<p>Here is a class named <code class="language-java">Patient</code>. An object of the class has a name, an age, and a height. The class has a constructor with 3 parameters to initialize objects with specific values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {

    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient(String name, int age, float height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's go further and create some instances of the class using the constructor we've written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient1 = new Patient("Heinrich", 40, 182.0f);
Patient patient2 = new Patient("Mary", 33, 171.5f);</code></pre>
<p>Now we have two patients, Heinrich and Mary, with the same fields, but the values of those fields are different.</p>
<h5 id="keyword-this">Keyword this</h5>
<p>In the example above, <code class="language-java">Patient</code> constructor takes three parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.height = height;</code></pre>
<p>To initialize the fields, the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code> is used, which is a reference to the current object. Usually, the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code> is used when an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an instance variable is a variable that is declared in a class and belongs to an instance of that class. | It is created when an object of the class is created, and destroyed when the object is destroyed. Each instance of the class has its own copy of the instance variable, and they can have different values. Instance variables can be accessed directly using the dot notation with an object reference. They are often used for st states that are unique to each instance of a class.">instance variable</a> and a constructor or a method variable share the same name. This keyword helps to disambiguate these situations.</p>
<p>If you write something like <code class="language-java">name = name</code>, it means that you're assigning the <code class="language-java">name</code> variable to itself, which, of course, doesn't make any sense. Frankly speaking, you may distinguish two objects simply by assigning another name to the variable, like <code class="language-java">name = newName</code>. It is not prohibited, but it is considered bad practice since these variables point to the same thing. These are the reasons why the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code>is extremely useful with constructors, fields, and methods. The absence of extra variables makes the code look clearer and less overloaded.</p>

<p>If you define a specific constructor, the default constructor will not be created.</p>
<p>We can also define a constructor without any arguments, but use it to set default values for fields of a class. For example, we can initialize <code class="language-java">name</code> with <code class="language-java">"Unknown"</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {

    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Such no-argument constructors are useful in cases when any default value is better than <code class="language-java">null</code>.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Constructors </strong>are special methods used to initialize class objects when they are created using the <code class="language-java">new</code> keyword. They have the same name as the class they belong to and have no return type (not even void). Constructors are necessary for initializing class objects and can take parameters to initialize fields with specific values. The <code class="language-java">this</code> keyword is used in the constructor to reference the current object. If a class doesn't have explicit constructors, the Java compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor.<br/><br/>
