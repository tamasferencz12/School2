<div class="alert alert-warning">As you can see, an abstract class has two main differences from regular (concrete) classes: <strong>no instances</strong> and <strong>abstract methods</strong>.</div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Abstract methods</strong> are <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3597" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifier, return type (for method), and initial value (for variable). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. In the context of variables, a declaration specifies the type, name, and initial value of a variable. The type of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which value can be stored in it. Every variable has a name (also known as an identifier) to distinguish it from others. Before using a variable, it must be declared. The general form of a variable declaration is: `type identifier = value;`

<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>Here is an abstract class <code class="language-java">Pet</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public abstract class Pet {

    protected String name;
    protected int age;

    protected Pet(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public abstract void say(); // an abstract method
}</code></pre>
<p>The class has two fields, a constructor, and an abstract method.</p>
<p>Since <code class="language-java">Pet</code> is an abstract class we cannot create instances of this class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Pet pet = new Pet("Unnamed", 5); // this throws a compile time error</code></pre>
<p>The method <code class="language-java">say()</code> is declared abstract because, at this level of abstraction, its implementation is unknown. <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3597" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a concrete subclass is a concrete implementation of an abstract class that contains the implementation of all its abstract methods. | An abstract class is a class with abstract methods, which are methods without implementation.

<p>Below are two concrete subclasses of <code class="language-java">Pet</code>. You can see that they override the abstract method:</p>

        super(name, age);

    }
}

class Dog extends Pet {

    // It can have additional fields as well

    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);
    }

    @Override
    public void say() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We can create instances of these classes and call the <code class="language-java">say()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Dog dog = new Dog("Boss", 5);
Cat cat = new Cat("Tiger", 2);
        
dog.say(); // it prints "Woof!"
cat.say(); // it prints "Meow!"</code></pre>
