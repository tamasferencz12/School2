<p>Suppose, you're writing a Java program. Different errors may occur during its compilation or execution. We will divide all possible errors into two groups: <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a compile-time error is a type of error that prevents a Java program from being compiled due to issues such as syntax errors, incorrect keyword usage, missing symbols, improper source code file names, invocation of non-existing methods, and other issues. | These errors are different from run-time errors, which occur during the execution of a program. Compile-time errors are typically easier to identify and fix because they prevent the program from compiling, while run-time errors may not be discovered until the program is running.">compile-time errors</a></strong> and <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a run-time error, also known as a bug, is a type of error that occurs when a program is running. | These errors can cause a program to behave unexpectedly or even stop its execution. There are two subtypes of run-time errors: logic errors and unhandled exceptional events. A logic error occurs when a program produces a wrong result because the code is not correct, such as outputting hi! instead of hello!. Unhandled exceptional events include errors such as division by zero, not found file, and others. Run-time errors are different from compile-time errors, which prevent a Java program from being compiled due to issues such as syntax errors, incorrect keywords, and invoking non-existing methods.">run-time errors</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Let's look at cases where errors occur and how to avoid them.</p>
<h5 id="compile-time-errors">Compile-time errors</h5>
<p>Compile-time errors are errors that prevent a Java program from being compiled:</p>
<ul><li><p>a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a syntax error is a type of compile-time error that prevents a Java program from being compiled due to incorrect syntax. | These errors can include typos in keywords, missing symbols at the end of a statement, incorrect naming of methods, and invoking non-existing methods, among others. Syntax errors are different from exceptions, which are errors detected during program execution. To avoid syntax errors, programmers can use a modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a static code analyzer.">syntax error</a>: an incorrect keyword, a forgotten <code class="language-java">;</code> symbol at the end of a statement;</p></li><li><p>a bad source code file name;</p></li><li><p>invoking a non-existing method;</p></li><li><p>and many others.</p></li></ul>
<p>Consider an example of compile-time errors. The following program should output the string <strong>"Hello!" </strong>but it does not compile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class MyClass {

    public ztatic void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.printn("Hello!");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>There are two errors in this program:</p>
<ul><li><p>a typo in the keyword <code class="language-java">static</code>;</p></li><li><p>incorrect name of the method <code class="language-java">println</code>.</p></li></ul>
<p>If you fix these mistakes, it will be possible to compile this program.</p>
<p>To avoid such errors, programmers use a modern IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with a static code analyzer. This tool allows programmers to identify compile-time errors before the compilation. In addition, it is able to highlight warnings about more complex errors and weak places in your code, as well as tips on how to improve the code.</p>
<p>Over time, you will write code that contains fewer or even no compile-time errors.</p>
<h5 id="run-time-errors">Run-time errors</h5>
<p>Run-time errors (also known as "bugs") are errors that occur when the program is running. Run-time errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even stop the execution.</p>
<p>There are two subtypes of run-time errors:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3536" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a logic error is a type of run-time error that occurs when a program produces an incorrect or wrong result due to a problem in the code. | Unlike compile-time errors, logic errors do not prevent the program from running, but instead, they cause the program to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect output. For example, if a program is supposed to output hello! , but instead outputs hi! , this is a logic error. Logic errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect mathematical calculations, improper variable assignments, or incorrect conditional statements. To avoid logic errors, it is important to thoroughly test and debug your code, using techniques such as automated testing, code reviews, and debugging tools. Additionally, it can be helpful to use clear and concise code, as well as to follow best practices and coding standards. It is important to note that while logic errors can be frustrating and difficult to identify, they are a natural part of the programming process, and are often caused by honest mistakes or oversights.">logic errors</a></strong> â€“ when a program produces a wrong result because the code is not correct (for example, instead of <strong>"Hello!"</strong>, your program outputs <strong>"Hi!"</strong>);</p></li><li><p><strong>unhandled exceptional events</strong> like division by zero, not found files, and other unexpected cases.</p></li></ul>
<p>We will learn how to handle exceptional events (exceptions) in further lessons.</p>
<p>Avoiding such run-time errors is a more difficult task than avoiding compile-time errors. If your program compiles successfully, there are no guarantees that it does not have bugs. There are different strategies to find such errors:</p>
