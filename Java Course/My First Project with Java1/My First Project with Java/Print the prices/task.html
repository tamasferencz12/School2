<h5 id="theory">Theory</h5><p>Welcome to your first Java project! On Hyperskill, a <strong>project</strong> is a practical task where you apply skills from theoretical topics. Each project is a complete application: a game, a search engine, etc. To help you grasp the idea, let's write a simple net income calculator in this one!</p><p>This is the first <strong>stage</strong> in the project, a step in its development. For example, you can't create a Tetris game in one take; instead, break down the task into smaller steps â€” designing a game board or a menu. Same with our projects, each consists of multiple stages.</p><p>Below, you will find a <strong>description</strong> that gives a context behind what you should do. <strong>Objectives</strong> state the main task of the stage and the details.</p><p>Write your code in the Code Editor below and press <em>Run Solution</em> to check it. If your solution is correct, move to the second stage by pressing <em>Continue</em>.</p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>You've recently opened a new corner shop. It is relatively small; it contains only a bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, milk chocolate, doughnuts, and pancakes. The first version of the program will display a list of all the products with their prices.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ul><li><p>Print the <code class="java">Prices:</code> line;</p></li><li><p>Print the item names and prices from the Example below. Your output format should follow it.</p></li></ul><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>output at the end of this stage</em></p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Prices:
Bubblegum: $2
Toffee: $0.2
Ice cream: $5
Milk chocolate: $4
Doughnut: $2.5
